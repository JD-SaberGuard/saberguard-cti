# üéØ Threat Advisory ‚Äì Webflow Browser Dropper Campaign (September 2025)

## üìå Summary

This advisory describes a phishing campaign that abused **legitimate infrastructure**, including a **compromised business email account** and **Webflow/Wix-hosted websites**,  to distribute a stealthy **malware dropper**. The payload abused Microsoft Edge‚Äôs command-line flags to bypass user interaction and execute silently, dropping secondary payloads and establishing persistence.

---

## üì• Delivery Mechanism

- **Sender Address (Compromised):** `[redacted]@peacockpress.net`
- **Authenticated Sender:** `[redacted]@peacockpress.net`
- **Mail Server:** `smtp6.relay.iad3b.emailsrvr.com` ‚Üí (Rackspace Emailsrvr infrastructure)  
- **Phish Format:** HTML email with no visible attachment
- **Phishing Links (defanged):**  
    - hxxps://myastound[.]webflow[.]io ‚Üí impersonated browser update page  
    - hxxps://anisholi406[.]wixsite[.]com/my-site-2 ‚Üí second-stage malware delivery  

The email was delivered via **authenticated SMTP**, indicating either a credential compromise or abuse of the mail server by an insider. The phishing page was hosted on **Webflow.io**, a legitimate web development platform.

---

## üî¨ Payload Behavior

- The landing page served a fake browser update interface.
- Upon interaction, the dropper executed silently using:

msedge.exe --simulate-outdated-no-au


- **Unpacked files** were written to:
C:\Program Files\chrome_Unpacker_BeginUnzipping5728_*


- The payload used **WriteProcessMemory** and **CreateRemoteThread** for injection.
- Registry keys were written for **persistence** and **telemetry control**.
